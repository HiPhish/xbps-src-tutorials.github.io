# MAJOR CHANGES
I am planning major changes to the website.
https://meator.github.io/xbps-src-tutorials/ will be moved to
https://xbps-src-tutorials.github.io/. The directory structure will also be
modified. For example

```
https://meator.github.io/xbps-src-tutorials/xbps-src-tutorial/packaging-j4-dmenu-desktop.html
```

will become

```
https://xbps-src-tutorials.github.io/packaging/j4-dmenu-desktop.html
```

This change will make the URLs more concise. It also provides some advantages
for Google search. To give an example, Google doesn't show the favicon for
`https://meator.github.io/xbps-src-tutorials/` because it [doesn't like
subdirectory-level home
pages](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/favicon-in-search).

Contents of the website will not be changed (some links will be fixed, but the
tutorials will remain).

This is the first major breaking change and hopefully the last one. I want to
make these changes while the website is still "in its infancy". This change
should be pretty much final, so your bookmark will be safe after you update it
to `https://xbps-src-tutorials.github.io/`.

A new repository will be created under the [xbps-src-tutorials GitHub
organisation](https://github.com/xbps-src-tutorials). It will be based off (but
not forked from) this repo. This is done to allow for the
`https://xbps-src-tutorials.github.io` URL.  However, this repository will stay
and so will `https://meator.github.io/xbps-src-tutorials/`.

`https://meator.github.io/xbps-src-tutorials/` will be modified. It will be
replaced by a website that redirects the user to
`https://xbps-src-tutorials.github.io` (redirect verbally, not by using HTML
redirects). A HTML redirect will not be made because the readers should be aware
that the URL has changed and that they should update their bookmarks if they
have bookmarked `https://meator.github.io/xbps-src-tutorials/`.

This repository will no longer accept contributions. All contribution efforts
should be moved to the new repository.

# Xbps-src tutorials
This is a collection of tutorials describing the `xbps-src` package build system
of Void Linux. It is made using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).

## Building this book
### Dependencies
This book requires [`mdBook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook),
[`mdbook-toc`](https://github.com/badboy/mdbook-toc) and
[`mdbook-admonish`](https://github.com/tommilligan/mdbook-admonish).

You can use

```
sudo xbps-install mdBook mdbook-toc
```

to install the dependencies on Void Linux. Note that `mdbook-admonish` isn't
currently packaged on Void Linux. You can download its executable in
<https://github.com/tommilligan/mdbook-admonish/releases/latest>. You'll have to
extract the appropriate archive and put the executable into a directory in
`$PATH`.

### Build process
You mustn't build this book with raw `mdbook`. This repo provides a `book.sh`
script which handles book building. See `book.sh -h` for more info about the
script.

You can build this book with

```
./book.sh build
```

## Releases
[Releases](https://github.com/meator/xbps-src-tutorials/releases/latest) of this
tutorial are available for offline reading. They include a prebuilt book.

If you want the zipfile of the latest website deployment, go to
<https://github.com/meator/xbps-src-tutorials/actions>, select the top workflow
run, click on the `build` job and click on the `Upload artifact` action. It
should contain a link to a zipfile at the bottom of it.

## FAQ
### What's the release schedule of GitHub releases?
There is none! I will make a release whenever I feel like it or it I'll be asked
to do so.

### Why did you choose a program with half broken build system which doesn't even build without patches as your first example usage of xbps-src?
I believe it is useful to showcase `xbps-src`'s capabilities on a real-world
example. It lets me showcase a variety of features of `xbps-src` that aren't
commonly used in "normal" templates (but are still needed from time to time).

I, meator, also happen to be a co-maintainer of
[j4-dmenu-desktop](https://github.com/enkore/j4-dmenu-desktop). I am familiar
with its build system, which enables me to create a comprehensive tutorial on
the subject.

_j4-dmenu-desktop is also in my opinion a really cool program, so I wanted to
spread the word a bit._ But I chose it mainly for practical reasons.

### Why are you teaching people to use xbps-src wrong in the first half of packaging j4-dmenu-desktop?
The "na√Øve" approach of simply copying the build instructions one would normally
use when building the program to the template is pretty relatable. This is how
packaging systems with less abstraction like the AUR do it (but don't quote me
on that, I don't have much experience with the AUR).

By showing how to package programs wrong, I can showcase why are the "correct"
approaches better and what advantages do they have.

### Why mdBook?
mdBook is already used in [void-docs](https://github.com/void-linux/void-docs),
so Void Linux users are likely to be familiar with it. It has all the features
one would expect: it has nice theming support (not just white/black theme),
themes can be changed explicitly (it doesn't depend solely on
[prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)),
it has a simple interface for both readers and developers of the book and it
renders well on phones.

It also has print support, but that isn't a priority.

### What are the limitations of mdBook?
mdBook isn't really designed for long winded articles. It has lack of support
for table of contents inside a single page. This is partly fixed by
`mdbook-toc`, but the reader has to go to the beginning of the page to access
the TOC. A collapsible sidebar with TOC for example would be nicer.

mdBook [doesn't support copying blocks which use tabs for
indentation](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/1686). Tabs are
converted to spaces even when it's indented by tabs in markdown.

mdBook simplicity can be a double-edged sword. It lacks nice to have features
like trimming the last newline when copying a code block using the button or
[differentiating external
links](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/2326).

These things could probably be implemented by modifying the mdBook theme and
writing some custom Javascript. I don't have much experience with that, but
contributions are welcome!

### Can this tutorial be ported to something else than mdBook?
The tutorial is written pretty much in pure Markdown. The exceptions are the
usage of admonish (which shouldn't be difficult to replace) and the mdBook's
`{{#include}}` mechanism.

If some other system would provide better features, poring this tutorial to it
shouldn't be that difficult.

## Troubleshooting
### The book doesn't build! I'm getting a mdbook_admonish error!
The following error

```
[2024-03-04T22:54:06Z ERROR mdbook_admonish] Fatal error: ERROR:
      Incompatible assets installed: required mdbook-admonish assets version '^3.0.0', but did not find a version.
      Please run `mdbook-admonish install` to update installed assets.
